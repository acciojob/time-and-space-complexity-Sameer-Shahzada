	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>
Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as the input size grows. 
Time complexity helps developers evaluate whether a solution is efficient and scalable for large datasets. 
By analyzing Time complexity, we can compare different approaches and select the most efficient solution for a given problem.
</p>

<p>
<b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size. 
In many cases, an algorithm may require additional memory such as arrays or recursion stacks, which can result in O(n). 
Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> helps developers optimize memory usage and design better-performing applications.
