	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>
Time complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. It helps determine whether a solution is efficient and suitable for handling large amounts of data.
</p>

<p>
<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. An algorithm that requires additional storage proportional to the input size may have a memory usage of O(n).
